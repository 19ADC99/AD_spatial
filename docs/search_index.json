The study contains six slides, 3 from AD patients and 3 from healthy controls. The slides have been sequenced using 10X Genomics Visium technology and the raw data is available at the GEO accession number GSE220442. We have decided to retrieve the data from the ssREAD database. We will first import one slide to explore its content. Let’s check the content ST01101 ## An object of class Seurat ## 36601 features across 4701 samples within 1 assay ## Active assay: Spatial (36601 features, 2000 variable features) ## 3 layers present: counts, data, scale.data ## 2 dimensional reductions calculated: pca, umap ## 1 image present: slice1 Very well, we have an object of class Seurat containing the spatial transcriptomics data of the first slide. The object contains expression data from 36,601 genes across 4701 spots. Let’s plot the expression of the genes next to the gene counts for each voxel in the slide. plot1 = Seurat::VlnPlot(ST01101, features = c(&quot;nCount_Spatial&quot;)) + NoLegend() plot2 = Seurat::SpatialFeaturePlot(ST01101, features = &quot;nCount_Spatial&quot;, pt.size.factor = 0) plot3 = Seurat::SpatialFeaturePlot(ST01101, features = &quot;nCount_Spatial&quot;, pt.size.factor = 2000) patchwork::wrap_plots(plot1, patchwork::wrap_plots(plot2, plot3, ncol = 1), ncol = 2) Figure 1.1: Slide ST01101 overview 1.2 Import all Slides and Merge Now that we are familiar with the content of the first slide, let’s import them in batch and merge them into a single Seurat object. First, we import the slides into the list ST011_list. Each slide is also transfermed using the Seurat::SCTransform function. Since the images attached to each sample have all the same name, we also make sure that we change the orig.ident of each slide so that the images are not overwritten when we merge the slides together. ## Running SCTransform on assay: Spatial ## vst.flavor=&#39;v2&#39; set.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
